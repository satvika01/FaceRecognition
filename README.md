# Facerecognition using vision transformers
This project is a part of an intelligent **"Follow Me" drone system** that uses a **Vision Transformer (ViT)** model to recognize a specific individual from a custom face dataset and autonomously follow them in real time.
##  Project Objective

The goal is to enable a drone (simulated or real) to:
- Recognize a **specific known person‚Äôs face**
- Track and **follow them continuously** based on real-time recognition

Face recognition is powered by a custom-trained **Vision Transformer model** using a labeled dataset of known individuals.
##  Key Features

- ‚úÖ **Vision Transformer (ViT)** for high-accuracy face recognition
- üßë‚Äçü¶∞ Custom dataset training: One folder per person
- üé• Real-time face detection and identity verification from video input
